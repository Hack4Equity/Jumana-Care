## Jumana Care
Community-driven, compassionate maternal care made for you.

## Overview
Jumana Care is a community-based mobile app that empowers expectant and new mothers with a social network by:
- Connecting them with certified doulas near them or virtually,  
- Providing them with a journal to write their feelings and birthing expectations, shareable with their clinical care team,
- Facilitating group prenatal care (mom circles)
- Creating community by connecting mothers with others who have shared experiences and values
- Providing access to health education modules and social resources near them 

Jumana Care is the idea that community-based and relationship-focused care is empowering and actionable. Jumana Care is the Zocdoc of doulas.
